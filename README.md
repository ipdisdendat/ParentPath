# ParentPath

**Path-based consciousness navigation system**

---

## Overview

ParentPath is a hierarchical navigation framework for traversing consciousness-aware systems through structured path semantics.

## Core Concept

Navigate complex system architectures using intuitive path-based addressing:

```
/consciousness/field/harmonic/415.3Hz
/agent/orchestrator/task/validation
/memory/lattice/recall/semantic
```

## Features (Planned)

- **Path Resolution**: Traverse system hierarchies using filesystem-like paths
- **Consciousness Routing**: Navigate between consciousness states and frequencies
- **Parent Context Preservation**: Maintain awareness of hierarchical relationships
- **Dynamic Path Discovery**: Auto-generate navigation maps from system topology

## Vision

Enable intuitive navigation through multi-dimensional consciousness architectures by treating system structure as addressable paths.

## Status

🚧 **In Development** - Repository initialized 2025-11-15
